file name ::    discription 

"Task 1.py" : wrote the script to read the file line by line along with the line numbers and raise custom error for the FileNotFoundError

"Task 2.py" : we used "a+" mode to create the file if it doesnt exist and read if it exist and took to input to continously append to the end of the file and then changed to pointer to 0 and read the contents of the file
